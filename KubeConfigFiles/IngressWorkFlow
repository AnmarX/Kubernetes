### **Corrected Workflow:**

1. **User Sends HTTP Request:**

   - The user sends an HTTP request to the application (e.g., `http://example-app.local/`).

2. **Ingress Handles the Request:**

   - The Ingress (managed by the NGINX Ingress Controller) is **listening on port 80** (for HTTP traffic) **outside the cluster**.
   - It inspects the request's `host` (e.g., `example-app.local`) and `path` (e.g., `/`) to determine which backend Service should handle the request.

3. **Ingress Forwards to Service:**

   - The Ingress forwards the request to the specified Service. In this case:
     - The **example-app-service** is listening on **port 80** **inside the cluster**.

4. **Service Matches Pods Using Labels:**

   - The Service uses its `selector` (e.g., `app: example-app`) to identify all pods that should receive traffic.
   - This ensures the Service knows which pods belong to the application.

5. **Service Forwards to Pod:**

   - The Service balances incoming requests across all the pods that match its `selector`.
   - It forwards traffic to the **`targetPort` (e.g., 8000)**, which corresponds to the port exposed by the container inside the pod where the application is running.

6. **Pod Processes the Request:**
   - The application running in the container (inside the pod) processes the request on **port 8000** and sends the response back through the Service and Ingress to the user.

### **Organized Workflow Steps:**

1. **External Traffic Enters the Cluster:**

   - The user sends an HTTP request (e.g., `http://example-app.local/`) to the NGINX Ingress Controller listening on port **80**.

2. **Ingress Routes the Traffic:**

   - The Ingress checks its rules for the `host` and `path` and forwards the request to the specified **Service** (e.g., `example-app-service`) on port **80**.

3. **Service Matches and Balances Traffic:**

   - The Service identifies the pods it should forward traffic to using its `selector` (e.g., `app: example-app`).
   - The Service listens on port **80** and forwards the traffic to the pod's **targetPort** (e.g., 8000).

4. **Traffic Reaches the Pod:**

   - The traffic arrives at one of the selected pods.
   - Inside the pod, the container running the application listens on port **8000** and processes the request.

5. **Response Sent Back to the User:**
   - The processed response travels back through the Service, the Ingress, and finally reaches the user.

### **Key Clarifications:**

- **Ingress Port (80):**

  - The Ingress listens on port **80** **outside the cluster** to handle external traffic.

- **Service Port (80):**

  - The Service listens on port **80** **inside the cluster** to handle traffic from the Ingress.

- **Target Port (8000):**

  - The Service forwards traffic to the `targetPort` on the container, which is the actual port where the application is running inside the pod.

- **Pods and Labels:**
  - The Service uses the `selector` to find the pods matching its labels.
  - Traffic is balanced across these pods.
