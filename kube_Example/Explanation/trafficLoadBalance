## Detailed Explanation of Workflow:

1. **External User**
   - Initiates an HTTP/HTTPS request (e.g., visiting a URL).

2. **Azure Load Balancer (Automatic)**
   - Automatically provisioned by Azure when a Kubernetes Service of type `LoadBalancer` is created.
   - Receives requests on a public IP automatically assigned by Azure.

2. **NGINX Ingress Controller Service (`LoadBalancer`)**
   - Automatically set up when you deploy the Ingress NGINX Controller YAML.
   - Exposes the NGINX Ingress Controller Pod externally.

3. **NGINX Ingress Controller Pod**
   - Automatically manages and watches Kubernetes Ingress resources.
   - Routes incoming traffic based on Ingress resource rules you manually defined.

4. **Kubernetes Ingress Rules (Manual)**
   - Defined explicitly by you (e.g., `ingress.yml`).
   - Specifies routing based on hostnames or URL paths to backend services.

5. **Application Service (`ClusterIP`)**
   - Manually defined service that internally routes traffic within Kubernetes to your application Pods.

6. **Application Pod**
   - Pod deployed manually using a Deployment YAML (`deployment.yml`).

7. **Application Container**
   - Receives the request and handles the application logic.
