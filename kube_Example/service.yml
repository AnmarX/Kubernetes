# How the Flow Works:
#     Client → Service:
#       The client (another Pod or external client) sends a request to the Service's IP or DNS name on the port (e.g., 5432).

#     For example:
#       From another Pod: postgres-service:5432.
#       From external: <NodeIP>:<NodePort> or <LoadBalancerIP>:5432 (depending on Service type).

#     Service → Pod:
#       The Service receives the request on port: 5432 and routes it to the correct backend Pod.

#     Pod → Container:
#       The Service forwards the traffic to the container inside the Pod, on the targetPort (e.g., 5432).
